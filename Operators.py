x += 2 # Adds 2 to x value
X *= 2 # Multiples 2 with x value
a, b = 5, 6

# relational operators
# less than, greater than, equal to compare where we use ==
# <=, >=, != for not equal to, '!' is not in python

# Logical operators
# AND - both conditions true then true OR - any one condition should be true to get true and NOT - gives opposites
